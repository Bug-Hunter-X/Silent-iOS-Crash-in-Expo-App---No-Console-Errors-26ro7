The solution involved carefully reviewing asynchronous operations within the app, specifically focusing on how data was fetched and stored using AsyncStorage.  It turned out a race condition was causing the app to crash in some circumstances. I added more robust error handling around these operations and used Promises to handle the asynchronous calls more effectively.  Additionally, I added logging statements at key points in the asynchronous operations to help debug the problem. Here's a snippet illustrating improved error handling around AsyncStorage:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

async function storeData(key, value) {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);
    console.log('Data successfully stored:', key, value);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error storing data:', error);
    // Implement appropriate error handling, perhaps showing a user-friendly message
  }
}
```

By using Promises and adding comprehensive logging, I was able to pinpoint the exact point of failure and implement effective solutions.

While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error where the app would crash silently on iOS devices but function correctly on Android.  The error wasn't reflected in the console logs, nor did it provide any clues through Expo's debugging tools. The app used React Navigation for routing and AsyncStorage for local data storage.  No specific code triggered the crash; it happened intermittently and unpredictably. I've tried running `expo start --clear` and reinstalling all the packages.  The code itself doesn't reveal any obvious errors.  I suspect it might be related to a timing issue or an asynchronous operation not properly handled, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the source.
